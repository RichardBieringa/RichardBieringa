### About me

My name is Richard and I am software engineer located in Amsterdam ❌❌❌

- 🎓 I recently graduated with a master's degree in Computer Science from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

- 💖 I have a passion for distributed systems, cloud computing and containerization!


### Academic Stuff

I mastered the art of student debt 📈🚀 and enjoyed spending my time pursuing academic studies. If you enjoy distributed systems you might like some of my academic highlights!

**Master Thesis**:
The end of my academic career is marked by my research on the Kubernetes ecosystem and the various service mesh systems and architectures!

**Online Video Conferencing Systems**
Unfortunately COVID-19 hit during my master's curriculum, this meant that most of the lectures and course content was online. A great opportunity to evaluate the performance of online video conferencing systems. We had the pleasure of turning this project into an academic publication as seen in ACM's 2021 ICPE conference:

📘 [An Empirical Evaluation of the Performance of Video Conferencing Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447545.3451186)


### Languages and technologies

I currently use a lot of Python 🐍.

I want to introduce Rust and C++ to my tool belt soon.

**Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, C

**Technologies**: AWS, GCP, Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, React, Vue
